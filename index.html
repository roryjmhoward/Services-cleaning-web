				Story about us
			</h2>
			<p class="nino-sectionDesc">Core Services Cleaning is part of the Core Services brand. We operate from Kingswinford, West Midlands and provide cleaning services throughout the Black Country area. 

We are passionate about using environmentally friendly products that deliver the highest level of cleanliness. We favour traditional elbow grease teamed with modern cleaning equipment, rather than harsh chemicals. Read more about Green Grade Cleaning here. 

Our cleaners are energetic, professional, DBS-cleared and come with years of practical experience. All are trained in Core Cleaning Methods before starting, and receive retraining. Quality checks are carried out regularly. 

We prefer open and friendly communication with our clients as this results in a tailor-made specification that meets individual needs. Contact us for a quote today. </p>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">Domestic</h4>
								<p>Every home is unique. 

We price homes individually to reflect the budget and requirements of our customers. In order to achieve this we first visit for a free in-house quote. 

We consider the number of rooms, the level of cleaning needed and any specific requests our customer may have. The visit takes around 20 minutes, although this may vary. Next, we will create a tailor-made specification. We aim to provide customers with a personal copy within 24 hours of our visit. 

On the date of cleaning, our cleaning professionals will methodically work through the cleaning specification. For peace of mind our cleaners are vetted and will always wear I.D and uniform. Our cleaners usually work in pairs, using products and equipment supplied by Core Services. For more information see our FAQ page or call 01384 918 451.</p>

								<h4 class="nino-serviceTitle">End of Tenancy</h4>
								<p>Hassle free cleaning that holds up under inspection. 

Our end of tenancy service is perfect for tenants and property owners alike. As with all our services, we visit the property first and discuss cleaning requirements with our customers before providing a final quote. 

End of tenancy cleaning can include carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, oven cleaning, wall washing, and window cleaning, but these are considered additional services and will be charged as such. 

Please note: Freezers must be defrosted in advance of cleaning date. 

      Cupboards/wardrobes/cabinets must be emptied in order to be cleaned inside and out. In the instance of finding personal belongings, our cleaners are instructed to clean around them and inform management immediately. We do not take responsibility for moving or storing personal belongings. 

      The final level of cleanliness depends largely on how frequently they were cleaned before. We are unable to remove ingrained dirt from appliances and furniture that have not been cleaned since purchase. 

      Customers are responsible for providing access to any property and securing the property after end of service. 

      Core Services Cleaning reserves the right to cancel any appointment on failure of receiving complete payment information in advance. 

      We reserve the right to refuse any cleaning service if the condition of the property is deemed hazardous to the health and well-being of staff. Examples of this include, but is not limited to, hoarder cleanup, void property, squat/drug den cleaning, flood/fire cleanup and trauma cleaning. 

For full terms and conditions or a free in-house visit, please contact us today.</p>

								<p>The ultimate cleaning experience.
Green Grade is best for your home if you require any of the following:
Upgraded vacuuming system designed for allergy sufferers
Deluxe service
Greater flexibility when creating cleaning specification
Deeper cleaning of high-risk areas such as toilets and sinks
Wider range of eco-friendly products
Shine On guarantee
General tidying service throughout
Green Grade cleaning is a step above our usual Core Grade service, although both utilise green cleaning products along with a microfibre cleaning system. 

Core Grade cleaning is an affordable cleaning service that covers general surface sanitisation and cleaning of floors. Any customer can request this service, but we would recommend it especially for homes that do not require extensive special measures. 

Our Green Grade service is deluxe. This service goes above and beyond regular cleaning and may take longer than a weekly Core Grade service. 

Green Grade customers also benefit from an upgraded vacuuming system approved by the British Allergy Foundation. The vacuum is fitted with a double filtration system that produces HEPA 11 Filtration. This has been proven to reduce house dust mite allergen and cat allergen. The Core Services family is home to allergy sufferers and pet owners, and they noticed a difference after regular use. 

We confer with our customers to create a cleaning specification that includes any extra measures they request. A copy of this is then signed off at the completion of each clean. In the instance of a task being missed or not completed to a satisfactory degree, Green Grade customers may benefit from our Shine On guarantee. This is when a cleaning operative will return to the property to complete any outstanding work within three working days, free of charge. To qualify for this a customer must be present at the conclusion of each session, and must contact us within 24 hours. 

We try to be as flexible as possible with this service. 

Some prefer a mixed service, whereby certain areas of their home are cleaned to Green Grade standard while the rest is cleaned to Core standard. This would be reflected in the final invoice. Others book a weekly Core Grade service but will upgrade to Green Grade every six weeks, or as needed. 

Green Grade customers are always the first to benefit from any new cleaning methods and products we may implement. We rely on our Green Grade customers for their honesty in product reviews and feedback. 

Please contact us today to discuss further details.</p>
